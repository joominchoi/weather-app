Creating a weather forecast site using a weather API

**Course reference pages:** \
[Weather App](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app)

## Thoughts

## Learnings
- Be wary of typos when referencing key-value pairs from JSON data

## Recapping

## WIP
- Look of page should change based on the data - maybe by chaning the colour of the background or by adding images that describe the weather
- Design with 3 day forecast in mind to take into consideration free tier of WeatherAPI
- Add any styling you like!
- Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to test for low-end devices.
- Push that baby to github and share your solution below!
