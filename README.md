# The Odin Project: Weather App
Creating a weather forecast site using the weather API. You should be able to:
- Search for a specific location
- Toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius
- Look of page should change based on the data - maybe by chaning the colour of the background or by adding images that describe the weather
- Design with 3 day forecast in mind to take into consideration free tier of WeatherAPI

## Thoughts

## Learnings
- Be wary of typos when referencing key-value pair from JSON data

## Recapping

## WIP
1. Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.
2. Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.
3. Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
4. Set up a form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).
5. Display the information on your webpage!
6. Add any styling you like!
7. Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to test for low-end devices.
8. Push that baby to github and share your solution below!
